# cdh-twitter-example
essentially forked from https://github.com/cloudera/cdh-twitter-example

Why not actually fork it? I'd rather be forced to type up each line in my editor and make sure I understand what is going on, than simply fork some code and read through it. By actually typing the code, I force myself to make sure I process each line and understand what is going on.

This repository streams data from twitter, using CDH (Flume, Oozie, and Hive), to retrieve a list of users and total retweets based on a set of keywords. This gives a rough sense of how influential a user is in a certain field.

This is purely a didactic repository, though that may change as things go forward.
